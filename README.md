Modular, security-focused self-hosted toolkit with zero-trust defaults.

Done. Your stack is live and locked down.

### Philosophy
- Security by default
- Zero trust where it makes sense
- Everything self-hosted & open-source
- Modular: comment out what you don’t need

More docs, diagrams, and tool-specific guides coming soon™
